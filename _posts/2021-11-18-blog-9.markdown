# **Before creating a certificate you must enable the SSL module in apache**
### You must run the following command to enable the SSL module:
{% highlight ruby %}
a2enmod ssl
{% endhighlight %}

# **Below are the steps to create the SSL Certificate**
#### Step 1: Create the Certificate and the Key by the following command:
{% highlight ruby %}
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
{% endhighlight %}

#### **Below is the break down of the command above:**
* openssl: command to use openssl to make any certificates or keys.
* req: command used to request a certificate or key.
* x509: this number defines that it will be a self signed certificate.
* nodes: command used to skip the passphrase.
* days 365: makes the certificated valid for 365 days
* newkey rsa:2048: Makes a RSA key thats 2048 bits long.
* keyout: used to name the key file.
* -out: used to name the certificate file.

# **After you run the command you will be asked to answer the following question:**
* Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
* State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
* Locality Name (eg, city) []:
* Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
* Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
* Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
* Email Address []:

# **After you have moved both files in the desired location you must modify your config file**
#### You must turn on SSLEngine and define the correct file paths to the certification and key files.
#### Below is an example of a config file with SSL:
{% highlight ruby %}
<VirtualHost *:443>

    ServerName https://site1.internal

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "/etc//ssl/certs/certificate.pem"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc//ssl/key.pem"

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>
{% endhighlight %}

# **Now you have succesfully setup your SSL!!!**
### When you visit your website the following warning will display because it is a self signed certificate:
