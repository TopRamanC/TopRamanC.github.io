# **What is a SQL Query?**
#### A SQL Query is a process of retrieving data from a database.

# **You should know the following SQL commands:**
#### Data Definition - these commands help you define the database structure.
* CREATE
* DROP
* ALTER
* TRUNCATE

#### Example: this code will create a table name "Employee_table" with 3 columns for Employee_ID, FirstName, and LastName.
{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE TABLE Employee_table (
    Employee_ID int,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    LastName varchar(255),
);
{% endhighlight %}

#### Data Manipulation - these commands allow you to manipulate data by inserting, deleting or updating data.
* INSERT
* UPDATE
* DELETE

#### Example: this code will insert "Raman Chadha" to the employees table in the database.
{% highlight ruby %}
INSERT INTO Employee_table (FirstName, LastName)
VALUES ('Raman', 'Chadha')
{% endhighlight %}

#### Data Control - these commands are used to give permissions.
* GRANT
* REVOKE

#### Example: this code will grant the permission for SELECT to all users for the Employee_table
{% highlight ruby %}
GRANT SELECT ON Employee_table TO public;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Transaction Control - these commands are used to deal with a transaction.
* COMMIT
* ROLLBACK
* SAVE POINT

#### Example: this code will delete the employee with the employee ID 1729 and then the COMMIT will save all the transactions to the database.
{% highlight ruby %}
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeID = 1729
COMMIT;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Data Query - these commands are used to retreive data from a database.
* SELECT
* FROM

#### Example: this query will display the first name of all the employee who are above 35 years old in the employee table.
{% highlight ruby %}
SELECT FirstName
FROM Employee_Table
WHERE Age > 35;
{% endhighlight %}
