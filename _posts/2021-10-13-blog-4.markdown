# **Now that you have your server ready you need to create a html file to host on your server**
#### We will be using the simple index.html for this blog:
{% highlight ruby %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

#### We will be saving index.html in a directory called docs

# **Once you have your html file ready you need to move your directory conatining your index.html to /var/www/html**
#### Below is the command used to move your directory:
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo mv docs/ /var/www/html
{% endhighlight %}

# **Now that we have our file in the right place now we can go ahead and start the apache server**
#### Below is the command to start an apache server:
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo service apache start
{% endhighlight %}

# **Now your website is running!!**
# To access your website we need to visit https://127.0.0.1/docs/
